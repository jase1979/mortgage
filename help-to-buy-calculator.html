            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Understanding Help to Buy Schemes in the UK</h2>
            <p>Help to Buy schemes were introduced by the UK government to make homeownership more accessible, particularly for first-time buyers who struggle to save large deposits. There are two main types of Help to Buy: the <strong>Equity Loan scheme</strong> and <strong>Shared Ownership</strong>. Each works differently and suits different circumstances, so it is important to understand the details before committing.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">Help to Buy Equity Loan</h3>
            <p>Under the Equity Loan scheme, the government lends you up to <strong>20% of the property value</strong> (or <strong>40% in London</strong>) interest-free for the first five years. You need a minimum deposit of just 5%, and the remaining amount is covered by a standard mortgage. This means you only need a mortgage for 75% of the property price (or 55% in London), which typically gives you access to much better mortgage rates due to the lower loan-to-value ratio.</p>
            <p>After the initial five-year interest-free period, you begin paying interest on the equity loan at a rate of 1.75%, which increases annually by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus 2%. The equity loan must be repaid when you sell the property, remortgage to repay it, or after 25 years, whichever comes first. Crucially, because the loan is based on a <strong>percentage of the property value</strong>, the amount you repay will rise or fall in line with your home's market value at the time of repayment.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">Shared Ownership</h3>
            <p>Shared Ownership allows you to buy a share of a property, typically between <strong>25% and 75%</strong>, and pay rent on the remaining share to a housing association. You take out a mortgage on the share you own and can increase your ownership over time through a process called <strong>staircasing</strong>, eventually owning the property outright if you choose.</p>
            <p>Shared Ownership is available on both new-build and resale properties and is aimed at households with a combined income of £80,000 or less (£90,000 in London). Since 2021, the reformed Shared Ownership model includes a 10-year repair and maintenance period where the housing association covers essential repairs, reducing the financial risk for buyers.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">How to Use This Help to Buy Calculator</h3>
            <p>Our calculator helps you understand the financial breakdown of purchasing a home through either scheme. Simply enter the <strong>full property price</strong>, select your scheme, input your deposit amount and expected mortgage interest rate, and the calculator will show you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your estimated <strong>monthly mortgage payment</strong></li>
              <li>The <strong>government contribution</strong> (equity loan amount or housing association share)</li>
              <li>The <strong>mortgage amount</strong> you will need to borrow</li>
              <li>For Shared Ownership, your combined <strong>mortgage plus rent</strong> total monthly cost</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">Key Considerations Before Applying</h3>
            <p>Before committing to a Help to Buy scheme, consider the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Equity loan repayment risk:</strong> If property prices rise significantly, you will owe more than the original loan amount when you come to repay. Conversely, if prices fall, you repay less.</li>
              <li><strong>Interest charges after year 5:</strong> The equity loan interest starts at 1.75% and rises annually. Factor this into your long-term affordability planning.</li>
              <li><strong>Shared Ownership rent increases:</strong> Rent on the unsold share can increase annually, typically by RPI plus 0.5%. Make sure you can afford potential increases.</li>
              <li><strong>Selling restrictions:</strong> Both schemes have specific rules about selling. With Shared Ownership, the housing association may have first refusal on your property.</li>
              <li><strong>Mortgage availability:</strong> Not all lenders offer Help to Buy mortgages. Use a broker who specialises in government-backed schemes to find the best rates.</li>
            </ul>
